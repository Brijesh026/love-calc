# love-calc
This is a sample code for a react native app ready to go live.
This love calculator app basically demonstrates fetching data from a remote server & use of react-native-paper components.
In general it also shows use of function components, use of hooks for managing states, handling props, object destructuring, custom components, managing styles etc.
Thanks for reading.
